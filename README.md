# rosetta-pony-candidates

My Pony candidate(s) to [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code).

## evolution

This submission, which is now one of the [Pony solutions](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm#Pony) 
for the [Evolutionary algorithm](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) task, 
came about thanks to contribution from Chris Double, who showed me how I could easily use 
[`String` instead of `Array[U8]`](https://github.com/doublec/rosetta-pony-candidates/blob/use_strings/evolution/evol.pony).
