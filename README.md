# rosetta-pony-candidates

My Pony candidate(s) to [Rosetta Code](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code).

## evolution

This is my first primitive attempt at porting the [Java solution](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm#Java) 
for the [Evolutionary algorithm](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm) task 
to [Pony](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Pony).

Before I submit it to Rosetta Code, I would appreciate if people who are more skilled 
Pony coders than me will suggest improvements, because I know for sure that my first attempt 
clearly shows that I still have a few basic things to learn about Pony coding. Most likely, 
there are ways I have handled **reference capabilities** that need to be changed. Hopefully, 
it will be possible to do away with the *arrayVal* function.
